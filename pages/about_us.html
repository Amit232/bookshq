                      <p><strong>We at "ChainReaders"</strong> are book lovers. I could ramble on about books being the store of knowledge and wisdon, books being best friends of man and etc. To cut to the chase, books, according to us, are tools that empower our imagination. Books are to imagination 
                      what water is to the growth of a tree, what wings are to a bird, what hammer and saw are to a handyman, what a paintbrush is to a painter.</p>
                      <p>Reading books, novels in particular, is like conversing with some of the finest minds of our times.
                      Kudos to The Godfather, Forrest Gump,To Kill a Mockingbird, The Silence of the lambs, Fight Club for 
                      bringing to life characters portrayed in books of same title.
                      Us millenials, often have a tendency to relate books to films. Not mentioning classics such as War and Peace, Pride and Prejudice, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy would be a crime in the book-fiction-novel world.
                      As the quote goes, "Some books leave us free and some books make us free."</p>
                      <p><strong>We at "ChainReaders"</strong>, are a gang of four people, who are fanatics of fiction novels.
                      We are budding company whose whole thought process and core value is that books should be easily available to each and every individual.
                      Call us old school or of belonging to stone-age, we prefer hard copies instead of the ones available digitally.
                      The only practical reason is that it is so more fun in reading a paper printed hard copy instead of one on a reading device.<p>
